title:  "Not just Anora one: beyond  feminist or social critique, towards a diagnosis of the world"
---

It is incredibly unsatisfying to read *Anora*’s reviews: misled by the title sharing the name of the main character, critics have piled wheat on wheat, yielding a unidimensional interpretation of the movie as pertaining to the general field of social critique; namely, one portraying the precariousness of sex workers and overall abuse of women. Inevitably *Anora* is cast as a “Cinderella story” gone wrong, one about transactional love in which Anora (aka Annie) enamors Ivan, the son of Russian oligarchs, ending up once again disappointed in the end. A disclaimer is warranted: the movie indeed portrays gender inequality and unfair treatment of sex workers in very explicit ways, denouncing it clearly; however what reviews fail to see is that the movie is indeed about Ivan - **symbolically** - how his actions mirror the collapse of modern Western values and how the other figures in this parable deal with the consequences. I claim that *Anora* tries to warn about the impact of a growing mass of young men with no purpose, whose identities and potential for community-building are being hijacked by dangerous right wing ideologies. 

What is interesting is that Sean Baker managed to condense most of this in three simple scenes. Despite all the fuss about the sexual carnage on screen (the typical Catholic prudishness obfuscating the subtext) and ensuing comical moments, *Anora* boils down to its opening, twist, and ending.. <br>

<h2> Opening Dissonance</h2>

The first shot introduces us to a world of depravation: men in semi-private cubicles separated only by curtains along a long corridor enjoy lap dances by strippers whilst smoking cigars, drinking, waving money etc. During this intro we hear a flashy pop song playing - “Greatest Day” by Take That - a feel-good, night-out celebration type. Sound and image contrast, setting up for the initial diagnosis of the movie: the world is crippled with dissonance - it is not just that the world is not how it should be - it doesn’t even sound or look like what a collapsing world should. The facade of this construction everywhere: be a low-wage worker at McDonald’s but put on a smile, be an artist presenting a play or a movie or an exhibition theater about underprivileged communities without actually helping them in any way (extractivism) etc. At the individual level the organization of cities yields the feeling of detachment and self-absorption, at the physical level our senses reflect this dissociation: we are full but not satisfied, drained but not exhausted, alive but without agency. With this scene, Sean Baker is opening the lenses to his claim: the world is dissonant, something is awry here - it could be crippling institutions, growing urban-rural contrast - it could even be narratives at longer timescales  - and I’ll show you how.  <br>

<h2> The Thick of the Plot </h2>

The opening shot leads to Annie - who, despite being the main character - we barely get any info about besides some evasive statements about family and a fast shot in her house with her sister. Annie quickly meets Ivan, son of Russian oligarchs, who lives a luxurious life in a multi-story house by himself and uses his parents’ money to pay for Annie’s services. What follows is almost an hour of world and character building around the two, fragile as a pyramid of cards, preparing for the inevitable downfall. They have sex, they party, they drink, they travel - in one of these trips Ivan manages to convince Annie that he cares for her and wants to marry her.  <br>

This represents a shift from the transactional intimacy they had shared so far, demanding Annie to accept being emotionally vulnerable: despite initial skepticism, she allows herself to believe that this time this bond is not transactional. Shortly after they get married and return home. Half of the movie is gone by now and most critics would be complaining about a slow, tedious pace thus far, filled with intense excessive sexual scenes void of any meaning. But this all serves the purpose of the buildup - a strategy Sean Baker also applied in The Florida Project (2017) - cueing for a downfall which couldn’t be more obvious. In a drone shot that pans out, we see them on the mansion’s veranda: the typical cinema shot of peacefulness, the fragile facade about to crumble.<br>

<h2> Twist and Downfall </h2>

urns out Ivan’s family is highly religious - Russian Orthodox - and as soon as they hear about this marriage with a sex worker they immediately send some thugs and a priest to Ivan’s house to force them to annul it. A third character called Igor comes into the picture forming a symbolic triangle of sorts with Annie and Ivan. Igor is portrayed as a gopnik - a delinquent thug turned mercenary - but his values are slowly revealed to us to be different than expected. As soon as the thugs reach the house Ivan escapes and what ensues is a fight between Igor and Annie. Despite visually straightforward - we see Igor struggling to immobilize Annie - the subtext turns the scene into the defining moment in the movie. Even when Igor tries to capture her, he does so with almost comical unprofessionalism - specially contrasting with the traditional view of an effective cold Russian agent - resorting to cornering her, blocking her escape routes, refraining from actually knocking her out and tying her. In the middle of this open space there is a table with a clear glass, supported by a bronze statue. As soon as the fight develops, Annie kicks one of the thugs into the table, thereby breaking it. We realize that the statue - now holding onto thin air - almost resembles a Sisyphean figure, the Greek story of a king who betrayed Zeus and as a punishment had to eternally endure carrying a boulder uphill, only for it to roll every time it neared the top. <br>

Sisyphus represents the daily effort we make that might seem futile in facing absurdity of life - that we nevertheless undertake to create meaning and make sense of reality. The glass table the figure was holding (sustaining) represents the values of modernity - the religious beliefs, the idea of progress, enlightenment - a series of narratives that the West as a whole held. The glass itself could represent the crystal palace: the symbol of the industrial revolution, age of conquests - big lustrous and fragile. The glass breaking signifies the downfall of all these values, beautifully enacted by Ivan, a man-child with no purpose, whose life bears no meaning, drowned in hedonistic pleasure, incapable of facing responsibilities for his actions, dependent on others - a demeanor denounced by several other characters. In this sense Ivan stands for a generation of young men with nothing to lose while struggling to find a sense of identity and a community. It is the same demographic which is driving the growing political gender gap in Gen Z, with young men increasingly disinterested in left wing politics which have become more inert and moralistic; leaning toward right wing ideologies. One can argue that due to his family’s capital, Ivan has no excuse preventing him from exerting agency in his life, which leads to question: what then is the problem? And what are the effects of all of this on Annie? <br>

So here we stand halfway through the movie with questions, waiting for new alternatives to emerge.

After immobilizing Annie, Igor is the only character that seats on the bronze statue - which hints at what a solution might be: in the form of a man trying to get by, connected with his family (his grandma mostly) and the sole character in the movie with some moral spine: he is the only one that asks for Ivan to apologize to Annie at the end when the marriage is annulled - a gesture neither the other thugs nor Ivan’s parents perform.

The second half of the movie is a comedy of sorts which reinstates Ivan’s privilege and the impact his choices have on his community of friends and family as everyone searches for him. Throughout all of these scenes it is confirmed to us that Igor is a scrupulous person who continuously cares for Annie, expecting nothing in exchange - these interactions motivate the final shot. <br>

<h2> New world coordinates </h2>

After flying through different states, confronting an abusive dysfunctional family (Ivan’s) and being forced to face the disappointment of yet again a promise of genuine, non-transactional love falling apart - Annie now returns back to her home, her reality. Igor drives her in his grandma’s old car. Just before Annie leaves the car, Igor gives her the wedding ring which he sneakily stole - a last act of revenge and compensation of sorts. Again an act of kindness, a bona fide display of humanity. Can you put yourself in her shoes? After having faced a life of disappointment and economic exchange for intimacy, then finding someone who seems to act without ulterior motives? Bullshit - this is an act, a trap like always. We see this in her eyes; we see this as she moves on top of him and kisses him and proactively tries to have sex. She tries to enforce her model of expectations on the world, to project her reality. We also see Igor confused and perplexed, almost unable to reciprocate the moment, or doing so in an abrupt way. Then she looks at him and realizes he is actually cares for her, that these people do exist, that her of view of the world, her coordinates are not *the* truth - that it is more complex and nuanced. How disorienting, how shocking and tragic to have to let go of this defense mechanism, of past trauma, of the biased perceptions we call beliefs. How simultaneously despairing and relieving must it be to realize that there’s a door beyond the trauma in her body. How can she accept the potential for anything to be different given previous disappointments? How can she cast her perception in the new world coordinates?

The car hums quietly; she sobs on Igor’s shoulder, the blinkers keep switching, and the windshields sways back and forth, wiping the glass window of the future. <br>

Annie’s loss of coordinates isn’t just an individual loss triggered by her previous attachments, but rather an instance of a grander loss of coordinates - one where the Western world itself loses its guiding values into a desert of ideology and is now mourning, unable to assert a new direction amidst its new order.
