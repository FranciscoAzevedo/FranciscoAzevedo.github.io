title:  "Not just Anora one: beyond  feminist or social critique, towards a diagnosis of the world"
---

There’s an incredibly unsatisfying feeling when going through Anora’s reviews. Misled by the title sharing the name of the main character, critics have piled wheat on wheat, yielding a dry, squalid, unidimensional interpretation of the movie as pertaining to the general field of social critique, namely one portraying the precariousness of sex workers and overall abuse of woman. Reviews cast this movie as a “Cinderella story” gone wrong, one about transactional love in which Anora ends up being disappointed once again. A disclaimer is warranted: the movie indeed portraits gender inequality and unfair treatment in very graphical and explicit ways; however what reviews fail to see is that the movie is indeed about Ivan - symbolically - how his actions mirror the collapse of modern western values and how the other figures in this parable deal with the consequences. Despite all the fuss about the sexual carnage on screen (the typical catholic prudishness that obfuscates the subtext) and ensuing comical moments, Anora boils down to three simple scenes: opening, twist, ending. <br>

<h2> Opening Dissonance</h2>

The first shot introduces us to a world of depravation: men in semi-private cubicles separated only by curtains along a long corridor enjoy lap dances by strippers whilst smoking cigars, drinking, waving money at the girls - the whole shebang. During this intro, on the background there’s a flashy pop song playing - “Greatest day” by Take That - a feels good, night out celebration type. Sound and image contrast, setting up for the initial diagnosis of the movie: the world is crippling with dissonance - it is not just that the world is not how it should be - it doesn’t even sound/look like what a collapsing world should. The facade of this construction everywhere: be a low-age worker at McDonald's but put on a smile, be an artist presenting a play or a movie or an exhibition theater about underprivileged communities without actually helping them in any way (extractivism) etc. At the individual level the organization of cities yields the feeling of detachment and self-absorbent, at the physical level our senses reflect this dissociation: we are full but not satisfied, drained but not exhausted (your body could run a mile if only your head would allow for it), alive but without agency. With the opening scene Sean Baker is opening the lenses to his claim: the world is dissonant, something is awry here - it could be crippling institutions, growing urban-rural contrast - it could even be longer timescales narratives - and I’ll show you how. <br>

<h2> The thick of the plot </h2>

The opening shot leads to Anora (aka Annie) - who, despite being the main character - we barely get any info about besides some evasive statements about family and a fast shot in her house with her sister. Annie quickly meets Ivan, son of Russian oligarchs, who lives a luxurious life in a multi-story house by himself and uses his parents’ money to pay for Annie’s services. What follows is almost an hour of world and character building around the two, fragile as a pyramid of cards, preparing for the inevitable downfall. They fuck, they party, they drink, they travel - in one of these trips Ivan manages to convince Annie that he cares for her and wants to marry her. <br>

This represents a shift from the transactional intimacy they had shared so far, demanding Annie to accept being emotionally vulnerable: despite initial skepticism she allows herself to believe that this time this bond is not transactional. Shortly after they get married and return home. Half of the movie is gone by now and most critics would be complaining about a slow, tedious pace so far, filled with intense excessive sexual scenes void of any meaning. But this all serves the purpose of the build up - and the cue for the downfall couldn’t be more obvious. In a drone shot that pans out, we see them in the mansion’s veranda: the typical cinema shot of peacefulness - the fragile facade - about to crumble. <br>

<h2> Twist and Downfall </h2>

Turns out Ivan’s family is highly religious - Russian orthodox - as soon as they hear about this marriage with a sex worker they immediately send some thugs and a priest to Ivan’s house to force them to annul it. A third character - Igor - comes into the picture forming a symbolic triangle of sorts with Annie and Ivan. Igor is portrayed just as a gopnik - a delinquent thug turned mercenary, but his values are slowly revealed to us. As soon as the thugs reach the house Ivan escapes and what ensues is a fight between Igor and Annie. Despite visually straightforward - we see Igor struggling to immobilize Annie - the subtext turns the scene into the defining moment in the movie. Even when Igor tries to capture her, he does so in an almost comical unprofessionalism - specially contrasting with the traditional view of an effective cold Russian agent - resorting to cornering her, blocking her escape routes, refraining from actually knocking her out and tying her. At the middle of this open space there is a table with a clear glass, supported by a bronze statue. As soon as the fight develops Annie kicks one of the thugs into the table thereby breaking it. We realize that the statue - now holding onto thin air - almost resembles a Sisyphean figure, the old story of a king who betrayed Zeus and as a punishment had to endure carrying a boulder uphill, only for it to roll every time it neared the top, perpetually until his death.

Sisyphus represents the daily effort we make that might seem futile when facing the absurdity of life - but we do it nevertheless to create meaning and make sense of reality. The glass table the figure was holding (sustaining) represents the values of modernity - the religious beliefs, the idea of progress, enlightenment - a series of narratives that the west as a whole held. The glass itself could represent the crystal palace: the symbol of the industrial revolution, age of conquests - big lustrous and fragile. The glass breaking is the downfall of all these values, beautifully enacted by Ivan, a man-child with no purpose, whose life bears no meaning, drowned in hedonistic pleasure, incapable of facing responsibilities for his actions, dependent on others.

After immobilizing Annie, Igor is the only character that seats on the bronze statue - which hints at what another solution might be: in the form of a man trying to get by, connected with his family (his grandma mostly) and the sole character in the movie with some moral spine: he is the only one that asks for Ivan to apologize to Annie at the end when the marriage is annulled - a gesture neither the parent nor Ivan’s parents perform.

The second half of the movie is a comedy of sorts which reinstates Ivan’s privilege, the impact his choices have on his community of friends and family as everyone searches for him. Throughout all of these scenes it is confirmed to us that Igor is a scrupulous person which continuously cares for Annie, expecting nothing in exchange - these interactions motivate the final shot of the movie.

<h2> New world coordinates </h2>

After flying through different states, confronting an abusive dysfunctional family (Ivan’s) and being forced to face the disappointment of yet again a promise of genuine, non-transactional love falling apart - Annie now returns back to her home, her reality. Igor drives her home in his grandma’s old car. Just before Annie leaves, Igor gives her the marriage ring which he sneakily stole - a last act of revenge and compensation of sorts. Again an act of kindness a bona fide display of humanity. Can you put yourself in her shoes? After having faced a life of disappointment and economic exchange for intimacy, then finding someone that seems to act without second intentions? Bullshit - this is an act, a trap like always has been - we see this in her eyes, we see this as she moves on top of him and kisses him and proactively tries to have sex. She tries to enforce her model of expectations on the world. We also see Igor completely confused and perplexed, almost unable to reciprocate the moment. And then she looks at him and realizes he is actually genuinely caring for her, that these people do exist, that her of view of the world, her coordinates are not the only truth - that it is more complex and nuanced. How disorienting, how shocking and tragic to have to let go of this defense mechanism, of these biased perceptions we call beliefs. How simultaneously despairing and relieving must it be to realize that there’s a door beyond the trauma in her body. How can she accept the potential for anything to be different given previous disappointments: how can she cast her perception in the new world coordinates.

The car hums quietly, she sobs on Igor’s shoulder, the blinkers keep switching and the windshield wipers swing back and forward, opening up the glass window of the future.

Annie’s loss of coordinates isn’t just an individual loss triggered by her previous attachments, but rather an instance of a grander loss of coordinates, one where the western world itself loses its guiding values into a desert of ideology and is now mourning unable to assert a new direction amidst its new order.
