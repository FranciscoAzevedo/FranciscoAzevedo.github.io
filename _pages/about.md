I have a Bsc and a Msc in Electrical and Computer Eng. from [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). I did my Msc thesis in the field of Neuroimaging at [Laseeb](https://www.laseeb.org/). At the moment I am part of the [Learning Lab](http://neuro.fchampalimaud.org/en/research/group/Paton/) at Champalimaud Research, as a PhD candidate for [INCDP](https://fchampalimaud.org/champalimaud-research/education/incdp) 2022 cohort

I was part of the board leading (and writing *in*) my Uni's student journal [Diferencial](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) in these editions [1](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/edicoes/2016-17/) , [2](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/edicoes/2017-18/).
