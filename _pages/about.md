<br>

This site is a deposit of both my personal experiences and thoughts as well as a research profile. Personal posts may concern travel experiences, thoughts, notes on books etc. Post regarding research may consist of tutorials, data visualization, comments on papers etc. I write both in english and portuguese depending on the topic.
<br>

I have a Bsc and a Msc in Electrical and Computer EngÂº from IST, Lisbon, Portugal where I learnt about signal processing, control theory and machine learning among other topics. 
<br>

However I figured I had other interests and, after acquiring enough knowledge, decided to do my Msc thesis in the field of Neuroimaging at [Laseeb](https://www.laseeb.org/). A subset of my thesis was published as an [abstract]({{ site.url }}/assets/abstract.pdf) for ISMRM 2020.
