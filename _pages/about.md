![Me]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/FotoMinha2.png)

This site is a deposit of both my personal experiences and thoughts as well as a research profile, although being easily browsed in seperate. Personal posts may concern travel experiences, thoughts, book reviews etc. Post regarding research may consist of tutorials, data visualization, comments on papers, talks, conferences etc.

<br>

I have a Bsc and a Msc in Electrical and Computer Engº from IST, Lisbon, Portugal where I learnt about signal processing, control theory and machine learning. 

<br>

However I figured I had other interests and, after acquiring enough knowledge, decided to do my Msc thesis in the field of Neuroimaging at [Laseeb](https://www.laseeb.org/) supervised by Prof. Patrícia Figueiredo and Prof. Mário Figueiredo (both at IST) in collaboration with Dr. Wietske wan der Zwag (Spinoza Centre) and Dr. João Jorge (EPFL). A subset of my thesis was published as an [abstract](https://submissions2.mirasmart.com/ISMRM2020/ViewSubmission.aspx?sbmID=5028) for ISMRM 2020.
