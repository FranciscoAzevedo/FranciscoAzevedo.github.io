This site is a deposit of **personal** experiences but it will also contain posts about **research**.

I have a Bsc and a Msc in Electrical and Computer Eng. from [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), Lisbon, Portugal where I learnt about signal processing, control theory and machine learning, among other topics. 
<br>

However I figured I had other interests and, after acquiring enough knowledge, decided to do my Msc thesis in the field of Neuroimaging at [Laseeb](https://www.laseeb.org/). A subset of my thesis was published as an [abstract]({{ site.url }}/assets/abstract.pdf) for ISMRM 2020.

At the moment I am part of the [Learning Lab](http://neuro.fchampalimaud.org/en/research/group/Paton/) at Champalimaud Research.

I was part of the board leading (and writing *in*) my Uni's student journal [Diferencial](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) in these editions [1](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/edicoes/2016-17/) , [2](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/edicoes/2017-18/).
